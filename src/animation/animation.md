## Animation

**What is animation?**
Computer animation is a general term for a kind of visual digital display technology that simulates moving objects on-screen. 
Animation is a method in which pictures are manipulatede to appear as moving images. 

Commonly the effect of animation is achieved by a rapid succession of sequential images that minimally differ from each other. 
The illusion - as in motion pictures in general is thought to rely on the phi phenemenon and beta movement, but the exact causes are still uncertain.


I noticed that the entry point of animation is to start it at the location of something else.
