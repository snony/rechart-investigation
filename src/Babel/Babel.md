## Babel

Babel is a Javascript compiler (source code => output code). Like many other compilers it runs in 3 stages: parsing, transforming, and printing.
Here are the main things Babel can do for you:

* Transform syntax
* Polyfill features that are missing in your target environment (through ```@babel/polyfill```)
* Source code transformations (codemods)
