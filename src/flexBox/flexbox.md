# What is Flexbox?
The flexbox model provides for an efficient way to layout, align, and distribute space among elements within your document -- even when the viewport and the size of your elements is dynamic or unknown.

###### variables here:
* layout
* align
* distribute space among elements

## How to use Flexbox?
Start by defining the container of your element as a flex. and you do this as:
```display: flex ``` or ``` display: inline-flex``` for the inline variation.

## What is happening?
1. Setting the element for which has ```display: flex ``` is called **flex container** 
2. Its children are now called  **flex-item**

The above two form the foundation to using flexbox.

## Flex-container Properties
There are 6 flex-containers properties and these are:
1. **Flex-direction**
2. **Flex-wrap**
3. **Flex-flow**
4. **Justify-content**
5. **Align-items**
6. **Align-content**

####### Flex-direction
This property controls the direction in which the flex-items are laid along the main axis.Either horizontally, vertically or reversed in both directions.

These are described as **main-axis** and **cross axis**. The defaults are shown below
