# What is Flexbox?
The flexbox model provides for an efficient way to layout, align, and distribute space among elements within your document -- even when the viewport and the size of your elements is dynamic or unknown.

###### variables here:
* layout
* align
* distribute space among elements

## How to use Flexbox?
Start by defining the container of your element as a flex. and you do this as:
```display: flex ``` or ``` display: inline-flex``` for the inline variation.

## What is happening?
1. Setting the element for which has ```display: flex ``` is called **flex container** 
2. Its children are now called  **flex-item**

The above two form the foundation to using flexbox.
